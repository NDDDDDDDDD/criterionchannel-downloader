# criterionchannel-downloader
this is in beta, works but subtitles are currently not downloaded, you will have to do that by yourself, which isnt too hard

it will check for subtitles and download them into the finished folder, so don't worry about that
all you have to do is search "config" in the network tab in chrome and copy that url into the program when asked to, the rest it will do by itself. although remember to replace the "ADDHERE" in the python file and make it a valid file path.
